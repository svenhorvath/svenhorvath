# Hi, I'm Sven 👋

Head of Data Management & Digital Transformation at **Bauamt Vorderland** — a municipal cooperation in Vorarlberg, Austria.

I build practical tools for public administration digitalization: SharePoint solutions, Power Platform automation, n8n workflows, and Claude Code skills that actually solve real problems.

**Currently working on:**
- Digitizing municipal building processes for inter-regional cooperation
- Open-source Claude Code skills for developer productivity

**My philosophy:** Technology as a means, not an end. Quality over speed. Document everything.
